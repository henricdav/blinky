Adventsljusstake for the 21st century.

A christmas decoration light with a ATtiny85-PU. Programmed with Raspberry Pi and a little (a lot) of help from http://www.instructables.com/id/Programming-the-ATtiny85-from-Raspberry-Pi/

In order to create a sparkly effect the LEDs are divided into three sections with 6/6/7 LEDs each. Each section is controlled by PWM from the microcontroller.

The ATtiny drives three 2N3904 NPN-transistors which does the main switching for the LEDs.
